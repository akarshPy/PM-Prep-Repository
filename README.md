1. why PM?

    Product Management aligns perfectly with my background and interests with engineering foundation that helps me understand technical feasibility, A professional experience as a Digital marketer where I acquired client and consumer first mentality that has trained me to think in terms of users, data, and business impact, and a creative inclination from my early interest in art and design that drives me to build intuitive, user-centric solutions.
  
    As a marketer, I have worked on optimizing and promoting products after they are built, building right customer jurney from clicks to conversions, going forward I want to be involved earlier — defining the problem, shaping the solution, and owning outcomes end-to-end. This role gives me the opportunity to influence what gets built, why it gets built, and how it delivers value to both users and the business.

2. What surprised you?

    Ironically, the thing a PM does the most is say “no.” Some people 
believe that product managers just dictate what features to build. Given 
everyone has lots of ideas for features, why bother with a PM? It’s true 
that everyone has lots of ideas, some of them good, but most ideas people 
have are for things they want, not necessarily things customers want. 
For example, think of an engineer who spends her days using cryptic 
command-line tools—I’m sure you know someone like this! This engineer 
probably prefers keyboard shortcuts, dislikes GUIs, and favors using code 
to explicitly specify meaning. Now, imagine that engineer is part of a team 
working on an iPad word processor for senior citizens. Do you think the 
features the engineer would prioritize match what the customers need? A 
large part of a PM’s job is to figure out the small number of key features 
to prioritize for the customer, and to lay the groundwork for long-term 
business viability by gracefully saying “no” to the numerous requests that 
don’t fit the customer’s needs

3. How PM differs from your current role?

    In short, Digital Marketing drives users to the product, while Product Management defines and builds the product that users stay for.
    In detail, I have catorise them in 3 main areas,
  
    Stage of involment in the Project-
      DM: Engages mostly after the product or feature is built—launch, promotion, optimization.
      PM: Involved from ideation to delivery—problem discovery, requirements, prioritization, development, launch, and iteration.

    Ownership-
      DM: Owns performance metrics like CTR, CAC, ROAS, impressions, and conversions.
      PM: Owns product outcomes like adoption, retention, engagement, customer satisfaction, and revenue impact.

    Decision-Making
      DM: Optimizes within defined constraints (budget, creatives, targeting).
      PM: Makes strategic trade-offs—what to build, what not to build, and when—balancing user needs, tech feasibility, and business goals.
