1. why PM?

    Product Management aligns perfectly with my background and interests with engineering foundation that helps me understand technical feasibility, A professional experience as a Digital marketer where I acquired client and consumer first mentality that has trained me to think in terms of users, data, and business impact, and a creative inclination from my early interest in art and design that drives me to build intuitive, user-centric solutions.
  
    As a marketer, I have worked on optimizing and promoting products after they are built, building right customer jurney from clicks to conversions, going forward I want to be involved earlier — defining the problem, shaping the solution, and owning outcomes end-to-end. This role gives me the opportunity to influence what gets built, why it gets built, and how it delivers value to both users and the business.
