why PM?
  Product Management aligns perfectly with my back group and interests. I have engineering foundation that helps me understand technical feasibility,
  a professional experience as an associate in Digital marketing agencies with client and consumer first mentality that has trained me to think in 
  think in terms of users, data, and business impact, and a creative inclination from my early interest in art and design that drives me to build 
  intuitive, user-centric solutions.
  As a marketer, I have worked on optimizing and promoting products after they are built builing right customer jurney from clicks to conversions,
  but I want to be involved earlier—defining the problem, shaping the solution, and owning outcomes end-to-end. This role gives me the opportunity
  to influence what gets built, why it gets built, and how it delivers value to both users and the business.
